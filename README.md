HealthcareAnalytics


1. Introduction
Healthcare organizations are under increasing pressure to improve patient care outcomes
and achieve better care. While this situation represents a challenge, it also offers organizations an
opportunity to dramatically improve the quality of care by leveraging more value and insights from
their data. Health care analytics refers to the analysis of data using quantitative and qualitative
techniques to explore trends and patterns in the acquired data. While healthcare management uses
various metrics for performance, a patientâ€™s length of stay is an important one.
Being able to predict the length of stay (LOS) allows hospitals to optimize their treatment
plans to reduce LOS, to reduce infection rates among patients, staff, and visitors.


3. Project Goal
The goal of this project is to accurately predict the Length of Stay for each patient so that
the hospitals can optimize resources and function better.
